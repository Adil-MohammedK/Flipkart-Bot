/*

 It connects to an MQTT server then:
  - on 0 switches off relay
  - on 1 switches on relay
  - on 2 switches the state of the relay

  - sends 0 on off relay
  - sends 1 on on relay

 It will reconnect to the server if the connection is lost using a blocking
 reconnect function. See the 'mqtt_reconnect_nonblocking' example for how to
 achieve the same result without blocking the main loop.

 The current state is stored in EEPROM and restored on bootup
